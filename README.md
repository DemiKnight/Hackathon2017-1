## Conclusion
As of now, we have finished the tournament, and I am please to say we did win this time. However it was not this application that made us win, it was the hard work from Jaime & Jacob. They were working on the application that was intended for the "make us laugh" challenge. Using the raspberry Pi's motion sensory, they designed a ball game in python. However, I believe I gained a lot of knowledge about web development which I will make good use of in my [Screen Masters](https://github.com/DemiKnight/Screen-Master) project!
